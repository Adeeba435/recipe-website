    <h3 class="h3">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>3/4 cup dairy-free milk (we recommend cashew milk, but coconut or hemp milk would also work well)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2-3 Tbsp pumpkin purée (not pumpkin pie mix)</li>
        <li>1/2 heaping tsp ground cinnamon (*if using pumpkin pie spice, see notes)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground ginger (*if using pumpkin pie spice, see notes)</li>
        <li>1 healthy pinch ground nutmeg (*if using pumpkin pie spice, see notes)</li>
        <li>1 healthy pinch ground allspice (*if using pumpkin pie spice, see notes)</li>
        <li>1 healthy pinch ground clove (*if using pumpkin pie spice, see notes)</li>
        <li>1 healthy pinch ground cardamom (optional // *if using pumpkin pie spice, see notes)</li>
        <li> 1/8 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li> 1 ½ – 2 tsp maple syrup, more or less to taste (or sub stevia to taste)</li>
        <li> 1 shot espresso (or sub 1/4 cup strong brewed coffee, or 1 ½ -2 tsp Dandy Blend for caffeine-free option)
        </li>
        <li> 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>

   <p class="p"> 
        Caffeine-Free Option (Dandy Blend!)
    <br>Because we’ve been digging caffeine-free / low-caffeine drinks lately, we included a caffeine-free option too!

    <br>Have you ever tried Dandy Blend? It’s an herbal alternative to coffee that smells and tastes like coffee and is made
    of extracts of barley, rye, dandelion, and chicory. Somehow the gluten is (magically) removed during the extraction
    process, making it gluten-free to boot.

    <br>We’d heard it recommended in the health community for a while but had more or less written it off as “not as good as
    the real thing.” But upon sampling it recently, we were so impressed we bought a bag and have been using it in
    things like this drink and afternoon “lattes.” Caffeine-free “coffee” for the win.

    <p class="p">1. To a small saucepan, add dairy-free milk and water. Bring to a simmer, then add pumpkin purée,
        cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, clove, cardamom (optional), black pepper, and maple syrup. Whisk until
        smooth.
        <br>Note: A little separation is natural with both the pumpkin and dairy-free milk, so whisk/stir as needed to
        smooth.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        2. Add coffee, espresso, or dandy blend and vanilla and whisk until smooth.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        3. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more spices to taste, espresso coffee or dandy blend for stronger
        coffee flavor, or maple syrup for sweetness.
