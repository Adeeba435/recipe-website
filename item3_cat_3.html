    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>
    <p class="p">1. Prepare the noodles:
        <br>Fill a large bowl halfway with lukewarm water and slide in the rice noodles. If needed, add more water to the
        noodles or use a plate to weigh them down so they are submerged. Let the soak at least 10 minutes, or until
        ready to stir-fry.
    </p>

    <p class="p">2. Make the sauce:
        <br>Add all of the sauce ingredients to a medium bowl or large measuring pitcher and whisk to combine and dissolve
        the sugar. Taste, adding more sugar or salt if needed. It should be salty, tangy, and lightly sweet. Set aside
        until you are ready to stir-fry your noodles.</p>

    <p class="p">
        3. Prepare the tofu and drain the noodles:
        <br>Place a few layers of paper towels onto a sturdy plate and place the cubed tofu on top in a single layer. Add
        another few layers of paper towels on top, then place a sturdy plate on top. Give it a light press until some
        liquid is released from the tofu.

        <br>Once the noodles have soaked for at least 10 minutes, drain them in a colander. You should be able to bend them
        without snapping.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        4. Fry the tofu:
        <br>Heat up a large wok, a 14 to 16-inch, deep non-stick frying pan, or a large electric skillet to medium-high and
        add 2 tablespoons of oil. Once hot, add the prepared tofu. Let one side sear for about 1 minute or until it is
        golden. Use tongs or a spatula to flip your tofu pieces so 2 sides are golden.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        5. Stir-fry the vegetables and egg:
        <br>Add another tablespoon of oil into the pan, then crack the eggs in with the tofu. Give the eggs a quick stir,
        turn the heat down to medium, and add the garlic and shallots. Saut√© until the eggs are soft scrambled, 2 to 3
        minutes.

        <br>Push the eggs aside and add the carrot, cabbage, bean sprouts, and green onions. Turn the heat back up to
        medium-high and let the vegetables sear for 2 to 3 minutes, then stir until they are beginning to soften.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        6. Add the rice noodles:
        <br>Add the drained rice noodles and toss with the vegetables. Give the sauce a stir and pour it into the frying
        pan.

        <br>Add the peanuts and adjust the heat to bring it to a boil and then maintain a simmer. Let simmer until the
        noodles start to soften, tossing occasionally, about 5 minutes.

        <br>Carefully stir fry the rice noodles until they are thoroughly coated in the sauce, the noodles are al dente, and
        the sauce has mostly soaked in to form a tacky coating, 5 to 10 minutes. Turn off the heat.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        7. Plating:
        <br>Before plating, give the pad thai a taste. Add any additional seasoning to the sauce like vegetarian fish sauce,
        salt, or sugar, if needed.

        <br>Serve the pad thai hot with fresh cilantro, lime wedges, chopped peanuts, green onions, and red pepper flakes
        for topping.

        <br>Store leftover pad thai in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop.
