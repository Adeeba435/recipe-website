    <h1 class="h1">Turkish Coffee</h1>
    <h3 class="h3">Turkish coffee is rich and thick. Brewed on the stovetop with very fine grounds, it’s served in small
        cups, often with something sweet. Here’s how to make Turkish coffee in the traditional cezve.</h3>

    <h3 class="h3">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="a">
        <h3 class="h3">For the basic coffee</h3>
        <li> 1/3 cup water</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon Turkish coffee grounds</li>

        <h3>Optional</h3>

        <li>1/2 to 2 teaspoons sugar, depending on preference</li>
        <li>1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon or cinnamon, depending on preference</li>

        <h3>To serve:</h3>
        <li>Cold water</li>
        <li>Turkish delight or another sweet treat, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>

    <p class="p">1. Mix the coffee, water, and (if using) sugar or spices in the cezve:

        <br>Place the water and Turkish coffee grounds in a metal cezve (Turkish coffee pot). Add the sugar and/or spice, if using, to the pot along with the grounds. Stir with a small spoon or chopstick to combine.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        2. Begin brewing over medium-low heat:
        <br>Place the cezve on the stovetop and cook on medium-low heat, until the water just starts to boil. This should take about 3 to 4 minutes. Don’t try to rush the boiling, you want it to come to a slow simmer to give the coffee time to brew.
        
        <br>SIMPLE TIP!
        <br>Don’t walk away from your coffee as it brews. It does not take much for an unwatched cezve to boil over and make a mess.
        
        <br>Once you see the Turkish coffee start to boil and rise, remove from the heat. If you’d like foam with your Turkish coffee, spoon some of the foam out of the cezve and into your finjan (cup).
        
        <br>Once the coffee has settled down, return the pot to the stove and let it boil again. Repeat this process, removing the pot from the stove to let the coffee settle, and then re-boiling it 3 more times.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        3. Serve:

        <br>After the 4th time, pour the rest of the coffee into the finjan. Serve with a glass of cold water and a sweet treat like Turkish delight on the side.
    </p>
