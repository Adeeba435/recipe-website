    <h3 class="h3">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="a">

        <h3 class="h3">For the filling</h3>
        <li>2 Lisbon lemons, knobby ends trimmed off
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

        <h3 class="h3">For the crust</h3>
        <li>1 3/4 cups (188g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into cubes</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (35g) powdered sugar, plus more for sprinkling on top</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>

    </ul>

    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>
    <p class="p">1. Prepare the lemons:
        <br>Use a food processor with the second-to-thinnest blade attachment to slice your lemons. Cut them in half
        lengthwise if they are too large to fit through the slicer shoot. You can also slice the lemons as thinly as
        possible (about 1/8 inch) on a cutting board with your sharpest knife. Pick out and discard seeds, if you see
        any.

        <br>In a medium bowl, toss the sliced lemons and sugar. Tightly cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 24 hours
        and up to 48 hours. The lemons will macerate, releasing some of their juices.

    </p>

    <p class="p">2. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
        <br>Line the bottom of a 7x11-inch baking dish (glass or ceramic) with parchment. Then, spray it generously with
        cooking spray. You could use a 9x9-inch baking dish.</p>

    <p class="p">
        3. Make the crust:
        <br>In a food processor, pulse the flour, butter, powdered sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until pebbly in texture,
        about 30 seconds. Add the egg yolk and pulse for 10 to 15 seconds. The mixture should be crumbly and hold
        together when pressed between your fingers.

        <br>Transfer the mixture into the prepared baking dish and press it down with your hands into an even layer. Use
        your fingers to help guide it 1/2 inch up the sides. It’s ok if it’s imperfect as long as it’s about the same
        thickness throughout.

        <br>Bake the crust until golden at the edges, about 15 minutes.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        4. Make the filling:
        <br>Pour the lemon-sugar mixture, 4 eggs, and 1/4 teaspoon salt into the food processor, and process until the peels
        are broken down into 1/4- to 1/2-inch pieces. 
        <br>Pour the filling over the baked crust.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        5. Bake the lemon bars:
        <br>Bake it until set around the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center, about 25 minutes.

       <br> Allow them to fully cool on your kitchen counter.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        6. Serve:
        <br>Sprinkle the top with powdered sugar. Cut into squares and serve. These are gooey lemon bars, so you will not
        get clean cuts.
    </p>
