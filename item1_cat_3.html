        <li> 2 pounds (908g) ground chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium white onion, diced (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>1/2 jalapeño, deseeded and minced (about 1 tablespoon), optional</li>
        <li> 2 (1-ounce) packets taco seasoning, or 56 grams (1/2 cup) homemade</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup (237ml) beef stock or water</li>
        <li> 1 (15-ounce) can (425g) black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li> 3 1/2 cups red enchilada sauce (canned or homemade)</li>
        <li> 18 to 24 (4.5-inch) corn tortillas</li>
        <li> 1 pound (454g) Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (about 5 cups, lightly packed)</li>
        <li>Sour cream</li>
        <li>Chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>Sliced jalapeños</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>
    <p class="p">1. Preheat the oven 350°F (177°C)
    </p>

    <p class="p">2. Brown the meat:
        <br>Add the ground chuck to a 12-inch skillet. Bring the skillet up to medium heat. While the skillet is heating up,
        use a spoon to break apart the meat. Brown the meat, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 7 minutes. Once the meat is
        no longer pink, spoon off and discard the grease.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        3. Sauté the vegetables and season the meat:
        <br> Add the onions, garlic, and jalapeño to the beef and continue cooking over medium-high heat until the onions are
        translucent, about 6 minutes.

        <br>Sprinkle the taco seasoning and kosher salt over the mixture in the pan. Next, add the beef stock (or water) to
        the pan and stir until the meat mixture is evenly coated.

        <br>Finally, add the drained black beans to the skillet and stir to combine.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        4. Layer the casserole:
        <br>Pour 2 1/2 cups of the enchilada sauce into a pie dish or wide, shallow bowl. One at a time, dip corn tortillas
        into the enchilada sauce in the bowl, ensuring each is evenly coated in the sauce. Line the bottom of a
        9x13-inch casserole dish with the dipped tortillas, overlapping them slightly to completely cover the bottom of
        the baking dish.

        <br>Sprinkle 3/4 cup of the shredded cheese over this layer of tortillas.

        <br>Spoon half of the ground meat mixture over the cheese in an even layer. Top the beef with another 3/4 cup of
        cheese.

        <br>Repeat the layering process by dipping more tortillas, sprinkling about 1 cup of cheese, the remaining beef
        mixture, and another 1 cup of cheese. Top with the remaining tortillas dipped in the enchilada sauce.

        <br>Pour the remaining enchilada sauce from the bowl over the top of the assembled casserole. If you prefer a
        saucier casserole, pour an additional 1/2 cup of sauce over the entire casserole in the pan.

        <br>Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the surface of the enchilada casserole.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        5. Bake the casserole:
        <br>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake the casserole for 25 minutes.

        <br>Carefully remove the foil and bake until the cheese is completely melted and starting to bubble, another 10 to
        12 minutes.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
        6. Cool and garnish: 
        <br>Allow the casserole to cool on the countertop for 10 to 15 minutes. 
        
        <br>Cut the casserole into 8 squares. Serve the beef enchilada casserole garnished with sour cream, chopped cilantro, and jalapeño slices. 
        
        <br>Store cooled enchilada casserole leftovers in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        7. Cook the pancakes:
        <br>In a large non-stick skillet over medium low heat, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.

        <br>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter per pancake into your preheated pan and cook for 2 minutes or until the edges begin
        to dry out, take a peek at the bottom and flip once it has browned.
        This batter will be very airy and light and you won’t really notice bubbles form on top as you normally would
        with normal pancake batter.

        <br>Flip and cook the other side for another 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or until golden brown.

        <br>Place cooked pancakes on the wire rack inside the oven to keep them warm while you cook the remaining pancakes.
        <br>Brush the skillet with remaining vegetable oil in between batches.
