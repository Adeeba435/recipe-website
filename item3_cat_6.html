    <h1 class="h1">Egg Custard Pie</h1>
    <h3 class="h3">The simplicity of egg custard pie is the basis for its reassuring comfort. That, and the marriage of
        two contrasting textures: smooth, creamy custard and a crisp, flaky pie crust.

    <h3 class="h3">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="a">

        <li>1 store-bought or homemade pie crust</li>
        <li>1 cup (200g) sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (56g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 cups (480ml) whole milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>

    </ul>

    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>
    <p class="p">1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
        <br>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven. Lightly grease a 9-inch pie plate with butter.
    </p>

    <p class="p">2. Roll out the homemade crust:
        <br>Dust your countertop lightly with flour. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough to a 12-inch circle, about 1/8 to
        1/4-inch thick.

        <br>To roll the dough, start at the center and roll outwards to the edges. Rotate the dough as you roll to keep
        the dough circular. If the dough starts to stick, lightly dust the dough or the rolling pin with more flour.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        3.Transfer the dough to the pie plate:
        <br>Carefully transfer the dough into a 9-inch pie dish. To do this while minimizing the risk of tearing the dough,
        use the rolling pin to roll up the dough, then unroll it into the pie dish. Gently press in the dough to line
        the lightly greased pie dish.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        4. Crimp the edges of the pie dough, then freeze:
        <br>Roll and fold the overhang of dough to build up the edges, trimming any excess dough as you work around the pie
        dish. <br>Use your fingers or a fork to crimp the edges of the pie dough. Transfer the crust to the freezer,
        unwrapped to chill until the oven is preheated.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        5. Prepare the crust for pre-baking:
        <br>Remove the chilled crust from the freezer. Line the inside of the crust with enough heavy-duty aluminum foil or
        parchment paper that it extends over the edges. These make convenient handles for easy removal later and protect
        the rim of the crust from over-browning.<br>Fill with pie weights or dry beans about two-thirds full. This ensures
        the crust doesn’t puff up while baking.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        6.Par-bake the crust:
        <br>Bake the crust for 45 to 50 minutes or until lightly golden. Remove the foil and pie weights and let the crust
        cool slightly while preparing the filling.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        7. Reduce the oven temperature:
        <br>Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        8. Make the filling:
        <br>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, salt, and nutmeg.

        <br>Whisk in the eggs, followed by the melted butter, then the milk and vanilla extract. The filling will be
        quite liquid and pale yellow.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        9. Bake the pie:
        <br>You can place the pie onto a sheet pan before adding the filling into the parbaked crust (this will ensure that
        there is no spillage in your oven.

        <br>Pour the filling into the parbaked crust. Carefully transfer the pie to the oven and bake, 50 to 55 minutes.
        <br>The custard should be set at the edges, but still wobbly in the center. An instant-read thermometer inserted in
        the center of the pie should read 170°F to 175°F. The custard may appear too liquidy, but it will set further as
        it cools.

        <br>If the edges of the pie start to get too dark you can cover them with a pie shield or strips of aluminum
        foil.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        10. Cool and chill:
        <br>Remove the pie from the oven and place it on a wire rack to cool to room temperature. When it’s completely cool,
        store the pie in the refrigerator until you’re ready to serve.
    </p>
