    <h3 class="h3">Ingredients</h3>
    <h3> For the pancakes</h3>
    <ul class="a">
        <li> 1 1/2 cup (180g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (48g) sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, separated</li>
        <li>1 1/4 to 1 3/4 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (113g) sourdough starter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (42g) butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li> 4 tablespoons (56g) vegetable oil</li>

        <h3> For serving</h3>
        <li>Maple syrup</li>
        <li> Berries</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>
    <p class="p">1. Combine the dry ingredients:
        <br>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
    </p>

    <p class="p">2. Separate the eggs.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        3. Combine the wet ingredients:
        <br>In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 1/4 cups milk with the sourdough starter, egg yolks, vanilla extract, and
        melted butter until no traces of sourdough or egg remain.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        4. Make the batter:
        <br>Using a rubber spatula fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until only a few traces of dry flour
        remain. (It’s okay if your batter is a little lumpy). The batter will be slightly thinner than typical pancake
        batter but not too much so that it was runny. Set aside.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        5. Whip the egg whites:
        <br>Using a whisk or a hand mixer whip the egg whites together until the soft peaks form. When you turn your whisk
        upside down, the peaks of your egg whites should just start to hold. Switch to a spatula and gently fold in 1/3
        of the egg whites into the batter until few streaks remain.

        <br>Fold the remaining whites into the batter, being careful not to knock the air out of the whites by folding too
        aggressively.

    <p class="p">
        6. Preheat your oven:
        <br>Preheat your oven to 170°F (or the warm setting if your oven has one.) Place a wire rack on a large sheet pan
        and put it in the oven as you cook your pancakes.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        7. Cook the pancakes:
        <br>In a large non-stick skillet over medium low heat, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.

        <br>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter per pancake into your preheated pan and cook for 2 minutes or until the edges begin
        to dry out, take a peek at the bottom and flip once it has browned.
        This batter will be very airy and light and you won’t really notice bubbles form on top as you normally would
        with normal pancake batter.

        <br>Flip and cook the other side for another 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or until golden brown.

        <br>Place cooked pancakes on the wire rack inside the oven to keep them warm while you cook the remaining pancakes.
        Brush the skillet with remaining vegetable oil in between batches.
