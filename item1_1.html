        <li> 1 egg, room temperature</li>
        <li> 1 egg yolk, room temperature</li>
        <li> 3 1/4 cups (390g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> 6 tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>

        <h3>For the filling</h3>

        <li>2/3 cup (140g) dark brown sugar</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (57g) butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 medium apples, peeled and chopped into 1/2-inch pieces</li>

        <h3> For the frosting</h3>
        <li>4 ounces (113g) cream cheese, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (57g) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (98g) powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>
        <p class="p">1. Make the dough:
            <br>Heat the milk in the microwave just until warm to the touch (about 110°F), about 30 seconds. Add the milk,
            sugar, and yeast to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Let the mixture sit until the yeast
            becomes foamy, about 5 minutes.

            <br>Add the egg and egg yolk and mix until combined. Add the flour and salt and continue to mix on medium speed
            until the ingredients come together into a ball of dough. Mix in the butter 2 tablespoons at a time, waiting
            until each addition is incorporated before adding more.

            <br>Once all of the butter is incorporated, knead the dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. The dough should have
            a smooth, shiny surface.
        </p>

        <p class="p">2. Let the dough rise:
            <br>Transfer the ball of dough to a greased bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a
            warm place until it has doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
            3. Roll out the dough and add the filling:
            <br>On a floured surface, roll out the dough into a 9x14 inch rectangle.

            <br>Mix the brown sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl.

            <br>Use a pastry brush to spread the softened butter evenly over the rectangle of dough, leaving a 1/2-inch
            border around the edges. Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture on top. Top with the chopped apples.

        </p>

        <p class="p">
            4. Form the cinnamon rolls and let rise:
            <br>Tightly roll up the dough, starting at the shorter 9-inch side. Using a sharp knife or a piece of unflavored
            dental floss, cut the log of dough into nine 1-inch pieces.

            <br>Transfer the cinnamon rolls to a greased 9x9 baking dish so the cut side is facing up. Cover with plastic
            wrap or a dish towel. Put it in a warm place and let the dough rise again until they look pillowy and are
            touching one another in the dish, 30 minutes to an hour.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
            5. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
            <br>Once the dough has been rising for 20 minutes, preheat the oven.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
            6. Bake:
            <br>Bake the cinnamon rolls until they are golden brown, about 25 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center
            roll should come out clean.

        </p>

        <p class="p">
            7. Make the frosting:
            <br>Make the frosting while the cinnamon rolls are baking. Using a hand mixer with beater attachments, beat the
            cream cheese and butter together on medium speed until well-mixed and creamy. Add the maple syrup and
            vanilla and mix until incorporated.

            <br>Add the sugar 1/4 cup at a time, beating after each addition, until all of the sugar is incorporated.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
            8. Top with frosting:
            <br>Let the cinnamon rolls cool for 10 minutes, then spread the frosting on top and serve warm. Store cooled
            leftovers in an airtight container for up to 2 days.
        </p>
