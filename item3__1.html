    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>
    <p class="p">
        1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F
    </p>

    <p class="p">2. Beat the eggs:
        <br>Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and whisk until there are no egg whites visible and it begins to look a little frothy. Set aside.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        3. Cook the vegetables:
        <br>Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a cast-iron pan over medium heat. Add the bell peppers, scallions, and tomatoes. Cook, until the peppers become brighter in color and the scallions become slightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes.
        
        <br>Add the spinach to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until it has wilted, about 1 minute. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        4. Assemble the frittata: 
        <br>Pour the whisked eggs into the pan over the vegetables. Layer the plantains over the eggs in a circular pattern until the pan is entirely filled.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        5. Drizzle with olive oil:
        <br>Drizzle the remaining olive oil (about a teaspoon), over the top of the plantains. Season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Garnish with chopped fresh rosemary.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        6.Bake the frittata:
        <br>Bake frittata for 15 minutes. Once its fully cooked, you will notice that the frittata will have risen, the plantains will be golden brown and slightly crispy.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        7.Serve:
        <br>Cut the frittata into quarters and serve 2 quarters per person. Sprinkle a pinch of chili flakes (optional) and serve alongside your favorite salad.
    </p>
