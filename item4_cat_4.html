    <h3 class="h3">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons avocado oil or other neutral oil</li>
        <li>4 large (8 to 10 cups) yellow onions, cut into 1/8-inch slices</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine, like Sauvignon Blanc</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>8 cups mushroom broth</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegan Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 (12-inch) French baguette, cut into 1-inch slices</li>
        <li>6 slices (about 6 ounces) Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (about 6 ounces) shredded gruyere cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>
    <p class="p">1. Caramelize the onions:
        <br>Heat a 5-quart Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Add the butter and oil. When the butter is melted, add the sliced onions, and stir to coat them in the fat.
        <br>Cook the onions for about 60 minutes, stirring about every 5 minutes with a wooden spoon, until caramelized. The onions should reduce in volume, become very soft, and turn a golden amber color with brown bits accumulating on the bottom of the pot.
        <br>As the onions cook, use the wooden spoon to scrape up the brown bits so that they don’t burn. 
    </p>

    <p class="p">2. Deglaze the pot:
        <br>Increase the heat to medium-high heat. Add the white wine and use the wooden spoon to scrape up the brown bits on the bottom and sides of the pot. Bring the wine to a boil and stir frequently for about 4 minutes or until most of the liquid has evaporated.</p>

    <p class="p">
        3. Add the flour:
        <br>Sprinkle the flour over the onions. Stir the mixture until no visible flour remains. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently. 
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        4. Add the broth, herbs, and seasoning:
        <br>Add the mushroom broth and use the wooden spoon to scrape any brown bits stuck to the bottom and sides of the pot.
        
        <br>Add the thyme, bay leaves, salt, and black pepper, and stir to combine.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        5. Simmer the soup:
        <br>Bring the soup to a slow boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        6. Finish the soup:
        <br>Stir in the Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar. Scoop out the thyme stems and bay leaves and discard them.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        7. Meanwhile, preheat the broiler. 
        <br>Set the oven rack to the top, closest to the broiler, and turn the broiler on high. 
        
        <br>Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange six oven-safe bowls or soup crocks on the baking sheet. 
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        8. Broil and serve: 
        <br>Ladle the soup into the bowls. Fill the bowls leaving 1/2- to 1-inch space on top for the bread and cheeses. Top each with 2 slices of baguette, 1 slice Swiss cheese, and about 1/4 cup Gruyere cheese.
        
        <br>Carefully place the baking sheet into the oven and broil for 2 to 5 minutes. Keep an eye on it so that the tops don’t burn. Broil until the cheese is melted, bubbling, and just starting to brown. Serve it immediately while its warm.
