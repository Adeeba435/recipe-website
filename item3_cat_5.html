    <h3 class="h3">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="a">

        <li>1/2 cups (200g) flour mix (I use Bob’s Gluten-Free 1 to 1 Baking Blend)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (55g) oat flour (certified gluten-free)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (150g) rolled oats (certified gluten-free)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup (227g) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (111g) dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>10 ounces dark chocolate chips (roughly chopped)</li>


    </ul>
    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>
    <p class="p">1. Preheat the oven:
        <br>Preheat the oven to 375°F.
        
        <br>Line two baking sheets with parchment.
    </p>

    <p class="p">2. Mix the dry ingredients:
        <br>Combine the flours, oats, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.</p>

    <p class="p">
        3. Beat the butter and sugars:
        <br>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter and sugars until combined but not overly creamy or fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        4. Add the eggs and vanilla:
        <br>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition on medium speed. Add the vanilla and mix briefly to combine.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        5. Add the dry ingredients:
        <br>With the mixer on low, add the flour and oat mix in several additions..
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        6. Chop and add the chocolate:
        <br>Roughly and irregularly chop up the chips with a chef’s knife. Add them in by hand, using a wooden spoon, or using the stand mixer on low speed.
        
        <br>You can use regular semi-sweet morsels, of course, but I like to use the Ghirardelli 60 percent bittersweet chips because they are larger and easier to chop. So you get little bits of chocolate everywhere in the cookie, as opposed to just solid pieces.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        7. Bake the cookies:
        <br>Scoop the dough out by a rounded tablespoon scoop and arrange on the cookie sheet spaced a little apart. I got about 12 per cookie sheet.
        
        <br>Bake for about 8 minutes until they are golden around the edges. Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack to cool for about five minutes, and then transfer the cookies to the wire rack to cool completely. Repeat the process until all the dough is gone.
        
        <br>The cookies will keep 3 to 5 days in an airtight container, but you might have to microwave them for 10 seconds to get them to soften a bit if it’s closer to 5 days.
