            <li>1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 quart (4 cups) vegetable stock</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>
    <p class="p">1. Make the croutons:
        <br>In a medium skillet over medium heat, add the oil. Once hot, add the bread cubes and cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Set aside on a plate to garnish the soup with later.
    </p>

    <p class="p">2. Soak the dried mushrooms:
        <br>Bring a kettle of water to a boil. In a small bowl, place the dried porcini mushrooms and cover with boiling water. Soak for 20 minutes.
        
        <br>Set a fine mesh sieve over a large measuring cup or bowl. Pour the mushrooms over the sieve to strain the soaking liquid. Reserve the soaking liquid and add additional water to the soaking liquid, if needed, to make 4 cups. Set aside until ready to use.</p>

    <p class="p">
        3.Make the soup:
        <br>In a large pot set over medium-high heat add the oil. Once the oil is warm and shimmers, add the sliced cremini mushrooms.
        
        <br>Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes to allow some of the liquid to evaporate. Add in the garlic, onion, thyme, soy sauce, and strained porcini mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, or until the mushrooms are a deep golden color.
        
        <br>Add the stock, the mushroom soaking liquid, salt, pepper, and rice. Adjust the heat to medium-low so it cooks at a steady simmer (small bubbles). Cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Remove the thyme sprigs.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        4. Puree the soup:
        <br>Use an immersion blender to purée the soup until smooth.
        
        <br>If using a countertop blender, add 1/3 of the soup to the blender, place the lid onto the blender but remove the insert cap and cover with a thick, folded towel to prevent steam from building up.  
        
        <br>Keep your hand over the towel and blend until smooth. Return the soup to the pot. Repeat this blending process until all the soup has been puréed.
        
        <br>Stir in the lemon juice. Taste, and add more salt, pepper, or lemon juice, as needed.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        5. Serve the soup:
        <br>Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with croutons and chives.
    </p>
