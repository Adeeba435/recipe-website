    <h3 class="h3">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="a">

        <h3 class="h3">For the Donuts</h3>
        <li>1 1/4 cups whole milk, lukewarm (110°F to 115°F)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>4 1/2 cups (540g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>2 quarts neutral oil (like canola or vegetable oil), for frying, plus more for greasing the bowl</li>

        <h3 class="h3">For the glaze</h3>
        <li>6 cups (680g) powdered sugar, sifted</li>
        <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

    </ul>
    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>
    <p class="p">1. Activate the yeast:
        <br>Whisk together the lukewarm milk, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Set aside until foamy, about 10 minutes.
    </p>

    <p class="p">2. Make the dough:
        <br>Meanwhile, combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Add
        the frothy yeast mixture along with the eggs and butter.

        <br>Mix on medium-low speed until combined, about 1 to 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed.
        <br>Increase the speed to medium and knead the dough for 4 more minutes. The dough will be slightly sticky and mostly clear
        sides of the bowl but may still stick to the bottom.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        3. Proof the dough:
        <br>Transfer the dough to a large, lightly greased bowl, turning to coat, and cover with lightly greased plastic
        wrap. Place the dough in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        4. Roll out the dough and proof again:
        <br>Once proofed, punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough into a circle
        roughly 12 inches in diameter that is 1/2 inch thick.

        <br>Use a 3-inch round cutter to cut out about 12 rounds. Use a 1-inch cutter to cut out the center holes of
        each
        donut, reserving the holes to fry.

        <br>Gather any scraps and roll them into balls about the size of the holes. Transfer the donuts to a
        parchment-lined
        baking sheet and the holes to another parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing the cut dough at least 1/2 inch
        apart.

        <br>Cover both baking sheets with lightly greased plastic wrap. Let rise once more in a warm place for about 30
        minutes. The dough is proofed when you gently touch a donut and the dough slowly bounces back.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        5. Fry the donuts:
        <br>Fill a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pot (like a Dutch oven) with about 2 to 3 inches of oil; it should reach no
        more than halfway up the pot. Heat over medium heat until the oil reaches 350°F.

        <br>Line a platter or baking sheet with paper towels and set a wire rack over another baking sheet, placing both
        by your pot.
        <br>Without overcrowding the pot, fry 2 to 3 donuts at a time, turning once, until golden brown all over and
        puffed, 2 to 3 minutes.<br>Use a slotted spoon, kitchen spider, or chopsticks to transfer the donuts to the paper towels to
        drain for 1 minute, then transfer to the wire rack.

        <br>Return the oil to 350°F and finish frying the donuts in batches. Let cool for 10 to 15 minutes before glazing.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        6.Fry the donut holes:
        <br>Fry the donut holes a handful at a time until golden brown all over, about 1 minute, stirring and turning them
        frequently. Drain.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        7. Glaze:
        <br>If using a glaze, whisk together the ingredients until the mixture is smooth and glossy. Place the donuts, one
        by one, in the glaze and use a spoon to coat on all sides. Use 2 forks to remove from the glaze and let the
        excess drip off. Place on the wire rack until the glaze is set.

        <br>Homemade donuts are best eaten within a few hours but will keep in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
