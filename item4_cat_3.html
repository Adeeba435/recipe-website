    <h3 class="h3">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 large cloves garlic, grated</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger (from a 1-inch piece)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>6 cups fresh broccoli florets (about 2 pounds)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water<li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>
    <p class="p">1. Make the sesame dressing: 
        <br>Pour the oil into a small microwave-safe bowl or glass measuring cup. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap and use a paring knife to poke a hole in plastic wrap so steam can escape. Microwave on high until the oil is very hot, about 3 minutes. 
        
        <br>Carefully remove and discard plastic wrap. Stir in the grated garlic and ginger (you should hear sizzling), and let it stand for 5 minutes. You can cook the broccoli in the meantime. 
        
        <br>Whisk in the vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds, salt, and crushed red pepper flakes, if using.
    </p>

    <p class="p">2. Cook the broccoli: 
        <br>Place the broccoli florets in a large microwave-safe bowl (we used a 8-cup glass measuring cup) and pour 3/4 cup water over the broccoli. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and microwave on high until broccoli is tender-crisp, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring halfway through and re-covering the bowl. 
        
        <br>Carefully remove the plastic wrap and drain the broccoli into a colander set in the sink, and transfer it back into the bowl.</p>

    <p class="p">
        3. Toss and serve: 
        <br>Pour the prepared dressing over the cooked broccoli and toss to evenly coat. Garnish with more sesame seeds. Serve immediately or let it stand at room temperature for 20 minutes to let flavors meld.
