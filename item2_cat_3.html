    <ul class="a">
        <h3 class="h3">For the meatballs</h3>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken (90% lean or leaner)</li>
        <li>large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

        <h3 class="h3">For the adobo and vegetables</h3>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li> 1/2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, sliced</li>
        <li>4 large carrots, sliced into 1/4-inch thick rounds</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 green onion, sliced, for serving</li>

    </ul>
    <h3 class="h3">Method</h3>
    <p class="p">1. Make the meatball mixture: 
        <br>In a medium bowl, stir together the ground chicken, egg, breadcrumbs, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper until evenly mixed.
    </p>

    <p class="p">2. Make the adobo sauce mixture: 
        <br>In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, mix together the broth, coconut milk, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and pepper.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        3. Cook the meatballs: 
        <br>Place a large braising pan or high-sided skillet with a lid over medium heat and add the oil. When the oil is shimmering, use a small (1 1/2 tablespoon) cookie scoop or a spoon and your hands, shape the mixture into meatballs and gently drop them into the skillet as you go. 

        <br>Sprinkle the taco seasoning and kosher salt over the mixture in the pan. Next, add the beef stock (or water) to
        the pan and stir until the meat mixture is evenly coated.

        <br>Finally, add the drained black beans to the skillet and stir to combine.<br>Brown the meatballs for about 2 minutes on their first side, until golden brown. Use a spatula to gently turn them and brown them on another side, for 2 minutes more. Sauté them for one more minute, so all the sides have a little color or are at least opaque.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        4. Add the remaining ingredients and simmer: 
        <br>Scoot the meatballs to one side of the pan, and add the garlic cloves to the other side of the pan. Sauté for 1 minute, making sure they all come into contact with the oil and get a bit browned. Spread out the meatballs and add the onion, carrots, and bay leaf, using a spatula to poke them down around the meatballs.

        <br>Pour the adobo sauce mixture over the meatballs and vegetables. 

        <br>When the mixture comes up to a simmer, cover the pan and turn the heat to medium-low. Let simmer for 15 minutes.
    </p>

    <p class="p">
        5. Reduce the sauce and serve: 
        <br>Remove the lid, turn the heat up to medium-high, stir, and let simmer for another 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced, thickened, and glossy. 
        
        <br>Sprinkle green onions on top. Serve with rice or cauliflower rice.
        
        <br>Store any leftovers in a tightly lidded container in the refrigerator. To reheat, microwave each serving until piping hot, about 1 1/2 minutes.
